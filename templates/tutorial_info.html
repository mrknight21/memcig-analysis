    <h2>Annotation Tutorial – Conversational Information Gain</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>
      Informed public discussion is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy. While forums and debates are intended to inform the public, many conversations fail to do so, often devolving into the repetition of established talking points rather than providing new substance. Our goal is to understand how an audience perceives and judges the degree of new information gained from a discussion on a public matter. <br><br>

To this end, we introduce the concept of <strong>Conversational Information Gain</strong>. The emphasis is on the "gain"—a comment is not informative if it merely restates what is already widely known or has just been said. <br><br>

In this project, you will act as an informed observer or an audience of a public discussion. Given the established background knowledge on a topic and the ongoing dialogue, your task is to assign each new response a rating for its Conversational Information Gain on a scale of 1 to 4. As you evaluate each entry, ask yourself: <strong>"Does this statement provide a new perspective, novel evidence, or a substantive insight that helps me better understand or resolve the issue?"</strong><br><br>

    </p>

    <h3>Conversational Information Gain (1-4)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Measures how much a response advances the group’s shared understanding or helps resolve the topic, considering both their prior knowledge and the preceding dialogue.</strong>
    </p>
      <p>
          **Core Question:** <strong> Given what the group already knows, does this response help them understand the topic more deeply or move the discussion forward?</strong>
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1: <strong>No gain at all</strong>
        (Obstructs, is completely irrelevant, or repeats established information without adding meaning. Includes verbatim repetition or paraphrasing with no semantic change.)
      </li>
      <li>
        2: <strong>Minimal gain</strong>
        (Adds a small clarification, a minor supporting detail, or a slight nuance to an existing idea. The addition is noticeable but does not significantly expand understanding.)
      </li>
      <li>
        3: <strong>Incremental gain</strong>
        (Builds meaningfully on the discussion by adding new evidence, reasoning, or examples that go well beyond what was previously established.)
      </li>
      <li>
        4: <strong>Insightful gain</strong>
        (Substantially deepens understanding by introducing a novel perspective, or offering a reframing/solution that shifts the conversation in a valuable way.)
      </li>
    </ul>


<h3>What might have <em>low</em> CIG:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Repeat:</strong>
        Repeating or paraphrasing already-known information (common knowledge or previously discussed/mentioned content).
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Questioning:</strong>
        Simple questions that request information but don't provide new information themselves—unless they're rhetorical and implicitly convey new insight.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Situational:</strong>
        Information limited strictly to personal, temporal, or situational context that doesn't generalize meaningfully (e.g., "You agreed with me yesterday").
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Expected or Obvious Information:</strong>
        Statements that present obviously inferable or trivial information, not adding meaningful novelty (e.g., "I’ve never had a child before." from a child).
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Vague Statements:</strong>
        Statements too vague or general to provide specific implications or meaningful insights (e.g., "Everyone will die someday.").
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Off-topic or Irrelevant Information:</strong>
        Information unrelated to the main topic or conversational goals, not meaningfully contributing to understanding.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Common Knowledge or Self-evident Statements:</strong>
        Universally known or trivial facts that offer no substantive or novel contribution to the discussion.
    </li>

</ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Annotation Process</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Check the debate topic or goal</strong> to understand the overarching issue being discussed.</li>

      <li>
        <strong>Carefully read the prior knowledge section(which summarise what have been discussed so far) and the prior dialogue right before the target dialogue.</strong>
        We also have highlighted potentially important <strong>key phrases</strong> to guide your attention.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Examine each target response carefully.</strong>
        Key phrases within the response that are <em>semantically similar</em> to those in the prior context have been highlighted.
        These highlights <em>do not guarantee repetition or paraphrasing</em>, but they signal areas where close comparison is required.
      </li>

      <li>
        For each response, assign an <strong><em>Conversational Information Gain</em></strong> score (1–4).
        Consider <strong>who the speaker is</strong>, their <strong>stance</strong>, and <strong>what they have previously stated</strong>.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Enter your ratings</strong> using the Likert scale in the annotation interface.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once all required responses are annotated and no cards remain highlighted in pink, <strong>submit your annotation</strong>.
      </li>

    Prior Conversation Summary

  <div class="card-body">
    <p>The debate opened with two distinct perspectives on the relationship between firearms and public safety, each grounded in decades of professional experience.</p>

<p>On one side, <strong>criminologist</strong> Gary Kleck, citing his <strong>forty years</strong> of research on <strong>firearms and crime</strong>, argued that an <strong>armed citizenry deters violent offenders</strong> and ultimately <strong>saves lives</strong>. He contended that <strong>public policy</strong> should <strong>respect responsible gun ownership</strong> and stated his goal was to clarify the debate around <strong>defensive-gun-use statistics</strong>.</p>

<p>In opposition, R. Gil Kerlikowske drew upon his <strong>four decades</strong> in <strong>law-enforcement leadership</strong>, including as <strong>Seattle Police Chief</strong> and the nation’s “<strong>Drug Czar</strong>.” He argued that the <strong>prevalence of firearms</strong> <strong>complicates policing</strong> and <strong>endangers</strong> both <strong>officers and civilians</strong>. He maintained that gun availability <strong>does not reduce crime</strong> and that improvements in <strong>public-safety</strong> require <strong>tighter controls</strong> and <strong>smart prevention strategies</strong>, not more <strong>weapons on the street</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Provides a moderately informative anecdote about police firearm risks with self experience.
        However, considering his stance is known and "a few reported cases" have been mentioned in the prior conversation,
        the anecdote only provide incremental information of details but not new concept or angle. The first few sentences abut a brief
          tangent about economists do not improve understanding of the topic or the arguments.</p>

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This response re-frames the issue of gun theft by highlighting a broader threat
        to public safety. The speaker argues that if criminals can steal guns even from well-trained officers, unarmed
        citizens are at an even greater risk. The appeal is twofold: it implies that self-defense by armed, law-abiding
        citizens may be necessary, and it introduces a technological solution—biometric gun locks—to reduce the risk of
        theft. By citing a successful example from a Detroit-based startup, the argument is enriched with concrete
        evidence and practical innovation, making the case highly informative.</p>
