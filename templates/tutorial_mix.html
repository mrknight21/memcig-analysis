    <h2>Annotation Tutorial – Novelty, Relevance, Scope</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">

<p>Informed public discussion is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy. However, many debates fail to enlighten the public,
    often devolving into a repetition of established talking points rather than providing new substance.</p><br>
<p>Our goal is to understand how an audience perceives and measures the new information gained from such discussions.
    To this end, we introduce the concept of <strong>Conversational Information Gain (CIG)</strong>.
    The emphasis is on the "gain"—a comment is not informative if it merely restates what is already widely known or has just been said.</p><br>

<p>To help us analyze this concept, you will act as an informed observer or an audience of a public discussion.
    Given the established background knowledge and the ongoing dialogue, your task is to rate each response on three key aspect,
    all on a 1–4 scale: <strong>Novelty</strong>, <strong>Relevance</strong>, and <strong>Implication Scope</strong>.</p><br>

    <h3>1. Novelty (1–4)</h3>
    <p>
      Assesses whether the information is new compared to the Prior Knowledge and preceding dialogue. (A backward-looking check against the established context. Novelty is about newness only — it does not consider relevance, importance, or usefulness.)
    </p>
    <p>
      **Core Question:** <strong> Has this specific fact, idea, or perspective already appeared in the Prior Knowledge section or been stated earlier in the conversation? Or common sense</strong>
    </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>1 – Not at all novel:</strong> Repeats or paraphrases something already in the dialogue or Prior Knowledge, or states obvious/common-sense facts.<br>
    <em>Example:</em> “As I said earlier, aid has both pros and cons.” (Context: Previously mentioned aid program has pros and cons.)<br>
    <em>Example:</em> “Everyone dies at some point.” (Commonsense.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>2 – Minimally novel:</strong> Adds a minor or predictable detail to an idea already known. <br>
    <em>Example:</em> “Foreign aid programs means financial support for developing countries from developed countries.” (Note: Expected clarification.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>3 – Moderately novel:</strong> Contributes new evidence, a concrete example, or a supporting detail that expands or strengthens an existing idea.<br>
    <em>Rater's Thought: “This is a new fact, but it's being used to support a point we were already discussing.”</em><br>
    <em>Example:</em> “In Ghana, a government-run aid program increased rural school attendance by 40% in three years.” (Context: The conversation is about whether aid helps rural schools.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>4 – Highly novel:</strong> Introduces a new framework, principle, topic or line of reasoning that reframes the discussion or opens an entirely new direction.<br>
    <em>Rater's Thought: “We weren't talking about this before. This changes the conversation itself.”</em><br>
    <em>Example:</em> “A leaked 2022 audit revealed that 60% of international aid funds to several West African nations never reached their intended recipients.” (Context: The conversation was about the intended effects of aid, not its misappropriation.)
  </li>
</ul>

    <h3>2. Relevance (1–4)</h3>
    <p>
      Measures if the utterance's content provides substantive information (e.g., facts, opinions, arguments, examples) that is directly about the core topic or goal. This dimension strictly excludes procedural or meta-discourse contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      **Core Question:** <strong> Is this utterance content on-topic and contributing to the conversation’s main goal?</strong>
    </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>1 – Not at all relevant:</strong> Completely off-topic; no clear connection to the discussion’s goal. Or purely procedural.<br>
    <em>Example:</em> “Is anyone else hungry? I skipped lunch today.” (topic:“Foreign Aid in Africa”)
    <em>Example:</em> "Let's all take a quick coffee break."
    <em>Example:</em> "Bryan, your turn." (procedural call)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>2 – Minimally relevant:</strong> Loosely related; connection is indirect, hypothetical, or requires inference. <br>
    <em>Example:</em> “This reminds me of a book I read about coffee grower in Africa.” (topic:“Foreign Aid in Africa”)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>3 – Moderately relevant:</strong> Substantially related but not central — e.g., addresses a side issue, counterpoint, or secondary aspect of the discussion. <br>
    <em>Example:</em> “There are some similarities between this aid model and how nonprofits operate in Southeast Asia.” (topic:“Foreign Aid in Africa”)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>4 – Highly relevant:</strong> Directly and explicitly addresses the core topic or goal of the conversation. <br>
    <em>Example:</em> “Evidence shows that unrestricted aid often leads to dependency and undermines local governance.” (topic:“Foreign Aid in Africa”)
    <em>Example:</em> "Can you clarify what you mean by 'dependency'?" (topic:“Economic Dependency of Rural Tribe”)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Implication Scope (1–4)</h3>
    <p>
    Measures the intended reach and the generalisation of the implication.
    </p>
    <p>
    **Core Question:** <strong> For whom this statement is intended to be significant? How does the implication generalise to broader population?</strong>
    </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>1 – Local scope:</strong> Significant only to the immediate participants in the conversation. <br>
    <em>Example:</em> “Hi! How are you, Peter!” <br>
    <em>Example:</em> “Can you speaker louder? I can't hear you.”
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>2 – Bounded scope:</strong> Presents a self-contained fact, feeling, or stance without performing an act of generalization or further implication. The significance is confined to the speaker or the specific case. <br>
      <em>Example:</em> “The city of Los Angeles have 423 parks.” (A simple fact without further implication.)
      <em>Example:</em> "I support focus on school budgeting." (Opinion or stance without reason or principle that is generaliable.)
      <em>Example:</em> "Peter is 55 years old." (A personal fact.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>3 – Generalising(Inductive):</strong> Generalise a specific case (an experience, evidence, or observation) to a broader conclusion, issue, or public domain. <br>
    <em>Example:</em> “This local factory closure is a sign of a nationwide problem.” (Using a factory closure to imply the nationwide problem.)
      <em>Example:</em> “The last samurai died on 1877, and marked the end of the feudalism in Japan.” (Using a single samurai to imply the change of the generation.)
      <em>Example:</em> "My mother's career struggles show why school funding is so important." (Using his mum's experience to convey the importance of school funding of the community.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>4 – Universal(Deductive):</strong> States a broad, abstract principle, value, or norm that applies widely, framing the discussion in 'top-down' terms. <br>
    <em>Example:</em> “Access to clean water is a basic human right that governments must protect.” (Using the principle "water for basic human right" to argue for the policy.)
    <em>Example:</em> “This policy is wrong because all people deserve dignity.” (Using the principle "people deserve dignity" to argue against the policy.)
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mt-4">Annotation Process</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Check the debate topic or goal</strong> to understand the overarching issue being discussed.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Carefully read the prior knowledge section(which summarise what have been discussed so far) and the prior dialogue right before the target dialogue.</strong>
        We also have highlighted potentially important <strong>key phrases</strong> to guide your attention.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Examine each target response carefully.</strong>
        Key phrases within the response that are <em>semantically similar</em> to those in the prior context have been highlighted.
        These highlights <em>do not guarantee repetition or paraphrasing</em>, but they signal areas where close comparison is required.
      </li>
      <li>
        For each response, assign ratings for Novelty, Relevance, and Implication Scope using the 1–4 scales.
        Consider <strong>who the speaker is</strong>, their <strong>stance</strong>, and <strong>what they have previously stated</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enter your ratings</strong> using the Likert scale in the annotation interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once all required responses are annotated and no cards remain highlighted in pink, <strong>submit your annotation</strong>.
      </li>

    Prior Conversation Summary
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>The debate opened with two distinct perspectives on the relationship between firearms and public safety, each grounded in decades of professional experience.</p>

<p>On one side, <strong>criminologist</strong> Gary Kleck, citing his <strong>forty years</strong> of research on <strong>firearms and crime</strong>, argued that an <strong>armed citizenry deters violent offenders</strong> and ultimately <strong>saves lives</strong>. He contended that <strong>public policy</strong> should <strong>respect responsible gun ownership</strong> and stated his goal was to clarify the debate around <strong>defensive-gun-use statistics</strong>.</p>

<p>In opposition, R. Gil Kerlikowske drew upon his <strong>four decades</strong> in <strong>law-enforcement leadership</strong>, including as <strong>Seattle Police Chief</strong> and the nation’s “<strong>Drug Czar</strong>.” He argued that the <strong>prevalence of firearms</strong> <strong>complicates policing</strong> and <strong>endangers</strong> both <strong>officers and civilians</strong>. He maintained that gun availability <strong>does not reduce crime</strong> and that improvements in <strong>public-safety</strong> require <strong>tighter controls</strong> and <strong>smart prevention strategies</strong>, not more <strong>weapons on the street</strong>.</p>

        John Donvan(mod): Okay, I—I think we have impasse on this… And I— I wanna go to Chief
        Kerlikowske, Seattle police chief, because you were talking about British bobbies being unarmed,
        and preferring that in many situations because they felt being armed would invite assault, as
        there were some reported case of causality with stolen police guns, and yet Gary Kleck arguing
        for the motion said why are police armed in the first place unless it is to deter assault, do

       Provides a vivid anecdote about police firearm risks. While some details and examples are new, similar points were
       discussed earlier in the prior conversation, giving it moderate novelty (Novelty = 3); relevance is moderate (Relevance = 3) as it
       address the problem of police firearm risks, but also touch on an irrelevant economist joke aside;
       The implication scope is moderate (Scope = 3) while it is based on personal experience, it has possible implications
       for the broader society and general public.

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong>
       The speaker explicitly states they are repeating a previously made point (Novelty  =  1).
        The utterance is a direct rebuttal to an opposing viewpoint on the core topic of the debate (Relevance = 4).
        The speaker emphasise his universal belief that "armed citizens deter crimes" (Implication scope = 4).

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong>
       The speaker shifts the focus to a personal comfort issue, introducing some new information about the room
       temperature (Novelty = 3). While this comment is not directly relevant to the debate, the speaker ends
       with a general question that prompts the other speaker to elaborate—contributing only minimal relevance to the
       overall discussion (Relevance = 2). The implication of the statement is mostly limited to the immediate
       physical setting and moment, resulting in a narrow scope (Scope = 1).

      “I mean, sure, there have been cases where a criminal managed to <strong>steal a gun from a trained officer</strong>. But if

      <strong>unarmed citizen</strong>? I was talking to some unbelievable folks—real patriots, salt of the earth—and they’ve
      got some very interesting ways of keeping things safe, let me tell you. Why should we abandon <strong>firearms</strong>
      altogether, instead of exploring smarter solutions—like securing guns with personal biometric locks? There
      is a startup in Detroit that has developed a fingerprint-based AI gun-lock. They have trialed with the local
      <strong>police departments</strong>, and have seen a significant decline of <strong>stolen guns</strong>.”

    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong>
       This utterance is rated as highly relevant (4) because it directly addresses the core theme of firearm safety
        by proposing a tangible, on-topic solution. Its novelty (4) is also very high, as it breaks from the established
        pro/con dynamic to introduce an entirely new concept—smart gun technology—supported by the specific evidence
        of a startup in Detroit. The implication scope is best described as "generalising," (3) because the speaker uses this
        specific, local example to advocate for a much broader, nationwide application, effectively taking a single
        case and framing it as a model for solving a larger problem.

      These examples illustrate how to assign <strong>Novelty</strong>, <strong>Relevance</strong>,
      and <strong>Scope</strong> based on context. Focus on whether an response adds new information
      (Novelty), remains on-topic (Relevance), and implies a narrow or broad impact (Scope).
