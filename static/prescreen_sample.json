  "summary": "<p>The discussion on the efficacy of foreign aid began with two sharply contrasting perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>William Easterly, arguing from his background as a development scholar, contended that the current <strong>foreign aid</strong> system is <strong>structurally flawed</strong>. He asserted that it often fuels <strong>corruption</strong>, undermines <strong>government accountability</strong>, creates a cycle of <strong>dependency</strong>, and props up <strong>authoritarian regimes</strong> by distorting <strong>domestic incentives</strong>. In his view, <strong>sustainable progress</strong> must be driven by <strong>citizen-led development</strong> and <strong>entrepreneurial independence</strong>, which requires a commitment to <strong>rethink aid from the ground up</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Countering this, Gayle Smith drew on her experience in <strong>international development and crisis response</strong> to argue that <strong>well-designed aid programs</strong> have a profound positive impact. While acknowledging room for improvement, she stated it is misleading to suggest that <strong>aid inherently</strong> causes harm, pointing to successes in lowering <strong>HIV/AIDS rates</strong> and supporting <strong>economic modernization</strong> in post-conflict nations like <strong>Ethiopia</strong>. She concluded that the goal is to make aid <strong>strategic, transparent</strong>, and <strong>community-centered</strong>, viewing it not as charity but as a vital tool for <strong>long-term transformation</strong>.</p>",

When governments can rely on <strong>external funding</strong> instead of <strong>tax revenues</strong>, they become less accountable to their own citizens. In countries like <strong>Ethiopia</strong> and <strong>Uganda</strong>, we’ve seen <strong>authoritarian regimes</strong> strengthened—not weakened—by large aid flows.
