One of the biggest problems with foreign aid is that it distorts political incentives. When governments can rely on external funding instead of tax revenues, they become less accountable to their own citizens. In countries like Ethiopia and Uganda, we’ve seen authoritarian regimes strengthened—not weakened—by large aid flows. The road to development should start with empowering citizens, not bypassing them.",

  "prior_history": "John(mod): Today's debate topic is \"Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good.\" Let's begin with your opening remarks. William Easterly, you argue in favor of the motion—please begin.\n\n\n William Easterly(for): Thank you. My position is clear: the current aid system is fundamentally flawed and ineffective. It not only fails to deliver substantial progress but also unintentionally supports corruption. I'm not saying aid can't ever be helpful; rather, I differentiate sharply between the potential of a reformed aid system and the reality we currently face. Without significant reforms, aid to Africa will continue to cause more harm than good.\n\n\n John(mod): Thank you, Mr. Easterly. Gayle Smith, you oppose this motion. Your response?\n\n\n Gayle Smith(against): I acknowledge the issues William raised—the aid system indeed has flaws. But it's critical to recognize that these issues don't overshadow the significant achievements aid has accomplished. Programs like Ethiopia's commodity exchange and substantial reductions in HIV/AIDS cases highlight how targeted, responsible aid can effectively support communities without necessarily empowering corrupt leaders. The evidence is clear that aid, despite imperfections, does more good than harm.\n\n\n",
